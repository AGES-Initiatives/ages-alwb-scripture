psa9.text = "I will thank the Lord with all my heart! I will tell about all your amazing deeds! I will be happy and rejoice in you! I will sing praises to you, O sovereign One! When my enemies turn back, they trip and are defeated before you. For you defended my just cause; from your throne you pronounced a just decision. You terrified the nations with your battle cry; you destroyed the wicked; you permanently wiped out all memory of them. The enemy’s cities have been reduced to permanent ruins; you destroyed their cities; all memory of the enemies has perished. But the Lord rules forever; he reigns in a just manner. He judges the world fairly; he makes just legal decisions for the nations. Consequently the Lord provides safety for the oppressed; he provides safety in times of trouble. Your loyal followers trust in you, for you, Lord, do not abandon those who seek your help. Sing praises to the Lord, who rules in Zion! Tell the nations what he has done! For the one who takes revenge against murderers took notice of the oppressed; he did not overlook their cry for help when they prayed: ‘Have mercy on me, Lord! See how I am oppressed by those who hate me, O one who can snatch me away from the gates of death! Then I will tell about all your praiseworthy acts; in the gates of Daughter Zion I will rejoice because of your deliverance.’ The nations fell into the pit they had made; their feet were caught in the net they had hidden. The Lord revealed himself; he accomplished justice; the wicked were ensnared by their own actions. (Higgaion. Selah) The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol; this is the destiny of all the nations that ignore God, for the needy are not permanently ignored, the hopes of the oppressed are not forever dashed. Rise up, Lord! Don’t let men be defiant! May the nations be judged in your presence! Terrify them, Lord! Let the nations know they are mere mortals! Why, Lord, do you stand far off? Why do you pay no attention during times of trouble? The wicked arrogantly chase the oppressed; the oppressed are trapped by the schemes the wicked have dreamed up. Yes, the wicked man boasts because he gets what he wants; the one who robs others curses and rejects the Lord. The wicked man is so arrogant he always thinks, ‘God won’t hold me accountable; he doesn’t care.’ He is secure at all times. He has no regard for your commands; he disdains all his enemies. He says to himself, ‘I will never be upended, because I experience no calamity.’ His mouth is full of curses and deceptive, harmful words; his tongue injures and destroys. He waits in ambush near the villages; in hidden places he kills the innocent. His eyes look for some unfortunate victim. He lies in ambush in a hidden place, like a lion in a thicket; he lies in ambush, waiting to catch the oppressed; he catches the oppressed by pulling in his net. His victims are crushed and beaten down; they are trapped in his sturdy nets. He says to himself, ‘God overlooks it; he does not pay attention; he never notices.’ Rise up, Lord! O God, strike him down! Do not forget the oppressed! Why does the wicked man reject God? He says to himself, ‘You will not hold me accountable.’ You have taken notice, for you always see one who inflicts pain and suffering. The unfortunate victim entrusts his cause to you; you deliver the fatherless. Break the arm of the wicked and evil man! Hold him accountable for his wicked deeds, which he thought you would not discover. The Lord rules forever! The nations are driven out of his land. Lord, you have heard the request of the oppressed; you make them feel secure because you listen to their prayer. You defend the fatherless and oppressed, so that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them."

My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter, my shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge. I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and I was delivered from my enemies. The waves of death engulfed me, the currents of chaos overwhelmed me. The ropes of Sheol tightened around me, the snares of death trapped me. In my distress I called to the Lord; I cried out to my God. From his heavenly temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help. The earth heaved and shook; the roots of the mountains trembled; they heaved because he was angry. Smoke ascended from his nose; fire devoured as it came from his mouth; he hurled down fiery coals. He made the sky sink as he descended; a thick cloud was under his feet. He mounted a winged angel and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind. He shrouded himself in darkness, in thick rain clouds. From the brightness in front of him came hail and fiery coals. The Lord thundered in the sky; the sovereign One shouted. He shot his arrows and scattered them, many lightning bolts and routed them. The depths of the sea were exposed; the inner regions of the world were uncovered by your battle cry, Lord, by the powerful breath from your nose. He reached down from above and took hold of me; he pulled me from the surging water. He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hate me, for they were too strong for me. They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the Lord helped me. He brought me out into a wide open place; he delivered me because he was pleased with me. The Lord repaid me for my godly deeds; he rewarded my blameless behavior. For I have obeyed the Lord’s commands; I have not rebelled against my God. For I am aware of all his regulations, and I do not reject his rules. I was innocent before him, and kept myself from sinning. The Lord rewarded me for my godly deeds; he took notice of my blameless behavior. You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful; you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent. You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless, but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse. For you deliver oppressed people, but you bring down those who have a proud look. Indeed, you are my lamp, Lord. My God illuminates the darkness around me. Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army; by my God’s power I can jump over a wall. The one true God acts in a faithful manner; the Lord’s promise is reliable; he is a shield to all who take shelter in him. Indeed, who is God besides the Lord? Who is a protector besides our God? The one true God gives me strength; he removes the obstacles in my way. He gives me the agility of a deer; he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain. He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend even the strongest bow. You give me your protective shield; your right hand supports me; your willingness to help enables me to prevail. You widen my path; my feet do not slip. I chase my enemies and catch them; I do not turn back until I wipe them out. I beat them to death; they fall at my feet. You give me strength for battle; you make my foes kneel before me. You make my enemies retreat; I destroy those who hate me. They cry out, but there is no one to help them; they cry out to the Lord, but he does not answer them. I grind them as fine windblown dust; I beat them underfoot like clay in the streets. You rescue me from a hostile army; you make me a leader of nations; people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects. When they hear of my exploits, they submit to me. Foreigners are powerless before me; foreigners lose their courage; they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds. The Lord is alive! My protector is praiseworthy! The God who delivers me is exalted as king! The one true God completely vindicates me; he makes nations submit to me. He delivers me from my enemies; you snatch me away from those who attack me; you rescue me from violent men. So I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord! I will sing praises to you! He gives his chosen king magnificent victories; he is faithful to his chosen ruler, to David and his descendants forever.’"

In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted in you and you rescued them. To you they cried out, and they were saved; in you they trusted and they were not disappointed. But I am a worm, not a man; people insult me and despise me. All who see me taunt me; they mock me and shake their heads. They say, ‘Commit yourself to the Lord! Let the Lord rescue him! Let the Lord deliver him, for he delights in him.’ Yes, you are the one who brought me out from the womb and made me feel secure on my mother’s breasts. I have been dependent on you since birth; from the time I came out of my mother’s womb you have been my God. Do not remain far away from me, for trouble is near and I have no one to help me. Many bulls surround me; powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in. They open their mouths to devour me like a roaring lion that rips its prey. My strength drains away like water; all my bones are dislocated; my heart is like wax; it melts away inside me. The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to my gums. You set me in the dust of death. Yes, wild dogs surround me – a gang of evil men crowd around me; like a lion they pin my hands and feet. I can count all my bones; my enemies are gloating over me in triumph. They are dividing up my clothes among themselves; they are rolling dice for my garments. But you, O Lord, do not remain far away! You are my source of strength! Hurry and help me! Deliver me from the sword! Save my life from the claws of the wild dogs! Rescue me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the wild oxen! You have answered me! I will declare your name to my countrymen! In the middle of the assembly I will praise you! You loyal followers of the Lord, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! All you descendants of Israel, stand in awe of him! For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed; he did not ignore him; when he cried out to him, he responded. You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly; I will fulfill my promises before the Lord’s loyal followers. Let the oppressed eat and be filled! Let those who seek his help praise the Lord! May you live forever! Let all the people of the earth acknowledge the Lord and turn to him! Let all the nations worship you! For the Lord is king and rules over the nations. All of the thriving people of the earth will join the celebration and worship; all those who are descending into the grave will bow before him, including those who cannot preserve their lives. A whole generation will serve him; they will tell the next generation about the sovereign Lord.

The Lord frustrates the decisions of the nations; he nullifies the plans of the peoples. The Lord’s decisions stand forever; his plans abide throughout the ages. How blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he has chosen to be his special possession. The Lord watches from heaven; he sees all people. From the place where he lives he looks carefully at all the earth’s inhabitants. He is the one who forms every human heart, and takes note of all their actions. No king is delivered by his vast army; a warrior is not saved by his great might. A horse disappoints those who trust in it for victory; despite its great strength, it cannot deliver.

Settle in the land and maintain your integrity! Then you will take delight in the Lord, and he will answer your prayers. Commit your future to the Lord! Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf. He will vindicate you in broad daylight, and publicly defend your just cause. Wait patiently for the Lord! Wait confidently for him! Do not fret over the apparent success of a sinner, a man who carries out wicked schemes! Do not be angry and frustrated! Do not fret! That only leads to trouble! Wicked men will be wiped out, but those who rely on the Lord are the ones who will possess the land. Evil men will soon disappear; you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone. But the oppressed will possess the land and enjoy great prosperity. Evil men plot against the godly and viciously attack them. The Lord laughs in disgust at them, for he knows that their day is coming. Evil men draw their swords and prepare their bows, to bring down the oppressed and needy, and to slaughter those who are godly. Their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. The little bit that a godly man owns is better than the wealth of many evil men, for evil men will lose their power, but the Lord sustains the godly. The Lord watches over the innocent day by day and they possess a permanent inheritance. They will not be ashamed when hard times come; when famine comes they will have enough to eat. But evil men will die; the Lord’s enemies will be incinerated – they will go up in smoke. Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt, but the godly show compassion and are generous. Surely those favored by the Lord will possess the land, but those rejected by him will be wiped out. The Lord grants success to the one whose behavior he finds commendable. Even if he trips, he will not fall headlong, for the Lord holds his hand. I was once young, now I am old. I have never seen a godly man abandoned, or his children forced to search for food. All day long he shows compassion and lends to others, and his children are blessed. Turn away from evil! Do what is right! Then you will enjoy lasting security. For the Lord promotes justice, and never abandons his faithful followers. They are permanently secure, but the children of evil men are wiped out. The godly will possess the land and will dwell in it permanently. The godly speak wise words and promote justice. The law of their God controls their thinking; their feet do not slip. Evil men set an ambush for the godly and try to kill them. But the Lord does not surrender the godly, or allow them to be condemned in a court of law. Rely on the Lord! Obey his commands! Then he will permit you to possess the land; you will see the demise of evil men. I have seen ruthless evil men growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil. But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared! I looked for them, but they could not be found. Take note of the one who has integrity! Observe the godly! For the one who promotes peace has a future. Sinful rebels are totally destroyed; evil men have no future. But the Lord delivers the godly; he protects them in times of trouble.

Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother; he cannot pay God an adequate ransom price (the ransom price for a human life is too high, and people go to their final destiny), so that he might continue to live forever and not experience death. Surely one sees that even wise people die; fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away and leave their wealth to others. Their grave becomes their permanent residence, their eternal dwelling place. They name their lands after themselves, but, despite their wealth, people do not last, they are like animals that perish. This is the destiny of fools, and of those who approve of their philosophy. They will travel to Sheol like sheep, with death as their shepherd. The godly will rule over them when the day of vindication dawns; Sheol will consume their bodies and they will no longer live in impressive houses. But God will rescue my life from the power of Sheol; certainly he will pull me to safety. Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich and his wealth multiplies! For he will take nothing with him when he dies; his wealth will not follow him down into the grave. He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive: ‘May men praise you, for you have done well!’ But he will join his ancestors; they will never again see the light of day.

I am so upset and distressed, I am beside myself, because of what the enemy says, and because of how the wicked pressure me, for they hurl trouble down upon me and angrily attack me. My heart beats violently within me; the horrors of death overcome me. Fear and panic overpower me; terror overwhelms me. I say, ‘I wish I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and settle in a safe place! Look, I will escape to a distant place; I will stay in the wilderness. I will hurry off to a place that is safe from the strong wind and the gale.’ Confuse them, O Lord! Frustrate their plans! For I see violence and conflict in the city. Day and night they walk around on its walls, while wickedness and destruction are within it. Disaster is within it; violence and deceit do not depart from its public square. Indeed, it is not an enemy who insults me, or else I could bear it; it is not one who hates me who arrogantly taunts me, or else I could hide from him. But it is you, a man like me, my close friend in whom I confided. We would share personal thoughts with each other; in God’s temple we would walk together among the crowd. May death destroy them! May they go down alive into Sheol! For evil is in their dwelling place and in their midst. As for me, I will call out to God, and the Lord will deliver me. During the evening, morning, and noontime I will lament and moan, and he will hear me. He will rescue me and protect me from those who attack me, even though they greatly outnumber me. God, the one who has reigned as king from long ago, will hear and humiliate them. They refuse to change, and do not fear God. He attacks his friends; he breaks his solemn promises to them. His words are as smooth as butter, but he harbors animosity in his heart. His words seem softer than oil, but they are really like sharp swords. Throw your burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the godly to be upended. But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit. Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a normal lifespan. But as for me, I trust in you."

Exalt the one who rides on the clouds! For the Lord is his name! Rejoice before him! He is a father to the fatherless and an advocate for widows. God rules from his holy palace. God settles those who have been deserted in their own homes; he frees prisoners and grants them prosperity. But sinful rebels live in the desert.O God, when you lead your people into battle, when you march through the desert, the earth shakes, yes, the heavens pour down rain before God, the God of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. O God, you cause abundant showers to fall on your chosen people. When they are tired, you sustain them, for you live among them. You sustain the oppressed with your good blessings, O God. The Lord speaks; many, many women spread the good news. Kings leading armies run away – they run away! The lovely lady of the house divides up the loot. When you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver and with glittering gold. When the sovereign Judge scatters kings, let it snow on Zalmon! The mountain of Bashan is a towering mountain; the mountain of Bashan is a mountain with many peaks. Why do you look with envy, O mountains with many peaks, at the mountain where God has decided to live? Indeed the Lord will live there permanently! God has countless chariots; they number in the thousands. The Lord comes from Sinai in holy splendor. You ascend on high, you have taken many captives. You receive tribute from men, including even sinful rebels. Indeed the Lord God lives there! The Lord deserves praise! Day after day he carries our burden, the God who delivers us. Our God is a God who delivers; the Lord, the sovereign Lord, can rescue from death. Indeed God strikes the heads of his enemies, the hairy foreheads of those who persist in rebellion. The Lord says, ‘I will retrieve them from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, so that your feet may stomp in their blood, and your dogs may eat their portion of the enemies’ corpses.’ They see your processions, O God – the processions of my God, my king, who marches along in holy splendor. Singers walk in front; musicians follow playing their stringed instruments, in the midst of young women playing tambourines. In your large assemblies praise God, the Lord, in the assemblies of Israel! There is little Benjamin, their ruler, and the princes of Judah in their robes, along with the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali. God has decreed that you will be powerful. O God, you who have acted on our behalf, demonstrate your power, as you come out of your temple in Jerusalem! Kings bring tribute to you. Sound your battle cry against the wild beast of the reeds, and the nations that assemble like a herd of calves led by bulls! They humble themselves and offer gold and silver as tribute. God scatters the nations that like to do battle. They come with red cloth from Egypt, Ethiopia voluntarily offers tribute to God. O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God! Sing praises to the Lord, to the one who rides through the sky from ancient times! Look! He thunders loudly. Acknowledge God’s power, his sovereignty over Israel, and the power he reveals in the skies! You are awe-inspiring, O God, as you emerge from your holy temple! It is the God of Israel who gives the people power and strength. God deserves praise!"

Let none who rely on you be disgraced because of me, O sovereign Lord and king! Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me, O God of Israel! For I suffer humiliation for your sake and am thoroughly disgraced. My own brothers treat me like a stranger; they act as if I were a foreigner. Certainly zeal for your house consumes me; I endure the insults of those who insult you. I weep and refrain from eating food, which causes others to insult me. I wear sackcloth and they ridicule me. Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me; drunkards mock me in their songs. O Lord, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me! O God, because of your great loyal love, answer me with your faithful deliverance! Rescue me from the mud! Don’t let me sink! Deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep water! Don’t let the current overpower me! Don’t let the deep swallow me up! Don’t let the Pit devour me! Answer me, O Lord, for your loyal love is good! Because of your great compassion, turn toward me! Do not ignore your servant, for I am in trouble! Answer me right away! Come near me and redeem me! Because of my enemies, rescue me! You know how I am insulted, humiliated and disgraced; you can see all my enemies. Their insults are painful and make me lose heart; I look for sympathy, but receive none, for comforters, but find none. They put bitter poison into my food, and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink. May their dining table become a trap before them! May it be a snare for that group of friends! May their eyes be blinded! Make them shake violently! Pour out your judgment on them! May your raging anger overtake them! May their camp become desolate, their tents uninhabited! For they harass the one whom you discipline; they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish. Hold them accountable for all their sins! Do not vindicate them! May their names be deleted from the scroll of the living! Do not let their names be listed with the godly! I am oppressed and suffering! O God, deliver and protect me! I will sing praises to God’s name! I will magnify him as I give him thanks! That will please the Lord more than an ox or a bull with horns and hooves. The oppressed look on – let them rejoice! You who seek God, may you be encouraged! For the Lord listens to the needy; he does not despise his captive people. Let the heavens and the earth praise him, along with the seas and everything that swims in them! For God will deliver Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, and his people will again live in them and possess Zion. The descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who are loyal to him will live in it."

For I envied those who are proud, as I observed the prosperity of the wicked. For they suffer no pain; their bodies are strong and well-fed. They are immune to the trouble common to men; they do not suffer as other men do. Arrogance is their necklace, and violence their clothing. Their prosperity causes them to do wrong; their thoughts are sinful. They mock and say evil things; they proudly threaten violence. They speak as if they rule in heaven, and lay claim to the earth. Therefore they have more than enough food to eat, and even suck up the water of the sea. They say, ‘How does God know what we do? Is the sovereign One aware of what goes on?’ Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like, those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer. I concluded, ‘Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure and maintained a pure lifestyle. I suffer all day long, and am punished every morning.’ If I had publicized these thoughts, I would have betrayed your loyal followers. When I tried to make sense of this, it was troubling to me. Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple, and understood the destiny of the wicked. Surely you put them in slippery places; you bring them down to ruin. How desolate they become in a mere moment! Terrifying judgments make their demise complete! They are like a dream after one wakes up. O Lord, when you awake you will despise them. Yes, my spirit was bitter, and my insides felt sharp pain. I was ignorant and lacked insight; I was as senseless as an animal before you. But I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me by your wise advice, and then you will lead me to a position of honor. Whom do I have in heaven but you? I desire no one but you on earth. My flesh and my heart may grow weak, but God always protects my heart and gives me stability. Yes, look! Those far from you die; you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.

You destroyed the sea by your strength; you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water. You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you fed him to the people who live along the coast.

psa77.text = "Pay attention, my people, to my instruction! Listen to the words I speak! I will sing a song that imparts wisdom; I will make insightful observations about the past. What we have heard and learned – that which our ancestors have told us – we will not hide from their descendants. We will tell the next generation about the Lord’s praiseworthy acts, about his strength and the amazing things he has done. He established a rule in Jacob; he set up a law in Israel. He commanded our ancestors to make his deeds known to their descendants, so that the next generation, children yet to be born, might know about them. They will grow up and tell their descendants about them. Then they will place their confidence in God. They will not forget the works of God, and they will obey his commands. Then they will not be like their ancestors, who were a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that was not commited and faithful to God. The Ephraimites were armed with bows, but they retreated in the day of battle. They did not keep their covenant with God, and they refused to obey his law. They forgot what he had done, the amazing things he had shown them. He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors, in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. He divided the sea and led them across it; he made the water stand in a heap. He led them with a cloud by day, and with the light of a fire all night long. He broke open rocks in the wilderness, and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea. He caused streams to flow from the rock, and made the water flow like rivers. Yet they continued to sin against him, and rebelled against the sovereign One in the desert. They willfully challenged God by asking for food to satisfy their appetite. They insulted God, saying, ‘Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness? Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out, streams gushed forth. But can he also give us food? Will he provide meat for his people?’ When the Lord heard this, he was furious. A fire broke out against Jacob, and his anger flared up against Israel, because they did not have faith in God, and did not trust his ability to deliver them. He gave a command to the clouds above, and opened the doors in the sky. He rained down manna for them to eat; he gave them the grain of heaven. Man ate the food of the mighty ones. He sent them more than enough to eat. He brought the east wind through the sky, and by his strength led forth the south wind. He rained down meat on them like dust, birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores. He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp, all around their homes. They ate until they were stuffed; he gave them what they desired. They were not yet filled up, their food was still in their mouths, when the anger of God flared up against them. He killed some of the strongest of them; he brought the young men of Israel to their knees. Despite all this, they continued to sin, and did not trust him to do amazing things. So he caused them to die unsatisfied and filled with terror. When he struck them down, they sought his favor; they turned back and longed for God. They remembered that God was their protector, and that the sovereign God was their deliverer. But they deceived him with their words, and lied to him. They were not really committed to him, and they were unfaithful to his covenant. Yet he is compassionate. He forgives sin and does not destroy. He often holds back his anger, and does not stir up his fury. He remembered that they were made of flesh, and were like a wind that blows past and does not return. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and insulted him in the desert! They again challenged God, and offended the Holy One of Israel. They did not remember what he had done, how he delivered them from the enemy, when he performed his awesome deeds in Egypt, and his acts of judgment in the region of Zoan. He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams. He sent swarms of biting insects against them, as well as frogs that overran their land. He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with driving rain. He rained hail down on their cattle, and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock. His raging anger lashed out against them; he sent fury, rage, and trouble as messengers who bring disaster. He sent his anger in full force; he did not spare them from death; he handed their lives over to destruction. He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their reproductive power in the tents of Ham. Yet he brought out his people like sheep; he led them through the wilderness like a flock. He guided them safely along, while the sea covered their enemies. He brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountainous land which his right hand acquired. He drove the nations out from before them; he assigned them their tribal allotments and allowed the tribes of Israel to settle down. Yet they challenged and defied the sovereign God, and did not obey his commands. They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors; they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow. They made him angry with their pagan shrines, and made him jealous with their idols. God heard and was angry; he completely rejected Israel. He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh, the tent where he lived among men. He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured; he gave the symbol of his splendor into the hand of the enemy. He delivered his people over to the sword, and was angry with his chosen nation. Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins remained unmarried. Their priests fell by the sword, but their widows did not weep. But then the Lord awoke from his sleep; he was like a warrior in a drunken rage. He drove his enemies back; he made them a permanent target for insults. He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. He chose the tribe of Judah, and Mount Zion, which he loves. He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above; as secure as the earth, which he established permanently. He chose David, his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds. He took him away from following the mother sheep, and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and of Israel, his chosen nation. David cared for them with pure motives; he led them with skill."

psa88.text = "I will sing continually about the Lord’s faithful deeds; to future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness. For I say, “Loyal love is permanently established; in the skies you set up your faithfulness.” The Lord said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have made a promise on oath to David, my servant: ‘I will give you an eternal dynasty and establish your throne throughout future generations.’” O Lord, the heavens praise your amazing deeds, as well as your faithfulness in the angelic assembly. For who in the skies can compare to the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings, a God who is honored in the great angelic assembly, and more awesome than all who surround him? O Lord, sovereign God! Who is strong like you, O Lord? Your faithfulness surrounds you. You rule over the proud sea. When its waves surge, you calm them. You crushed the Proud One and killed it; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies. The heavens belong to you, as does the earth. You made the world and all it contains. You created the north and the south. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name. Your arm is powerful, your hand strong, your right hand victorious. Equity and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loyal love and faithfulness characterize your rule. How blessed are the people who worship you! O Lord, they experience your favor. They rejoice in your name all day long, and are vindicated by your justice. For you give them splendor and strength. By your favor we are victorious. For our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel. Then you spoke through a vision to your faithful followers and said: “I have energized a warrior; I have raised up a young man from the people. I have discovered David, my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him as king. My hand will support him, and my arm will strengthen him. No enemy will be able to exact tribute from him; a violent oppressor will not be able to humiliate him. I will crush his enemies before him; I will strike down those who hate him. He will experience my faithfulness and loyal love, and by my name he will win victories. I will place his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers. He will call out to me, ‘You are my father, my God, and the protector who delivers me.’ I will appoint him to be my firstborn son, the most exalted of the earth’s kings. I will always extend my loyal love to him, and my covenant with him is secure. I will give him an eternal dynasty, and make his throne as enduring as the skies above. If his sons reject my law and disobey my regulations, if they break my rules and do not keep my commandments, I will punish their rebellion by beating them with a club, their sin by inflicting them with bruises. But I will not remove my loyal love from him, nor be unfaithful to my promise. I will not break my covenant or go back on what I promised. Once and for all I have vowed by my own holiness, I will never deceive David. His dynasty will last forever. His throne will endure before me, like the sun, it will remain stable, like the moon, his throne will endure like the skies.” But you have spurned and rejected him; you are angry with your chosen king. You have repudiated your covenant with your servant; you have thrown his crown to the ground. You have broken down all his walls; you have made his strongholds a heap of ruins. All who pass by have robbed him; he has become an object of disdain to his neighbors. You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious, and all his enemies to rejoice. You turn back his sword from the adversary, and have not sustained him in battle. You have brought to an end his splendor, and have knocked his throne to the ground. You have cut short his youth, and have covered him with shame. How long, O Lord, will this last? Will you remain hidden forever? Will your anger continue to burn like fire? Take note of my brief lifespan! Why do you make all people so mortal? No man can live on without experiencing death, or deliver his life from the power of Sheol. Where are your earlier faithful deeds, O Lord, the ones performed in accordance with your reliable oath to David? Take note, O Lord, of the way your servants are taunted, and of how I must bear so many insults from people! Your enemies, O Lord, hurl insults; they insult your chosen king as they dog his footsteps. The Lord deserves praise forevermore! We agree! We agree!"

They will lift you up in their hands, so you will not slip and fall on a stone. You will subdue a lion and a snake; you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent. The Lord says, “Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he is loyal to me. When he calls out to me, I will answer him. I will be with him when he is in trouble; I will rescue him and bring him honor. I will satisfy him with long life, and will let him see my salvation.”"

The nations will respect the reputation of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor, when the Lord rebuilds Zion, and reveals his splendor, when he responds to the prayer of the destitute, and does not reject their request.

The Lord does what is fair, and executes justice for all the oppressed. The Lord revealed his faithful acts to Moses, his deeds to the Israelites. The Lord is compassionate and merciful; he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love. He does not always accuse, and does not stay angry. He does not deal with us as our sins deserve; he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve. For as the skies are high above the earth, so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers. As far as the eastern horizon is from the west, so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us. As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on his faithful followers. For he knows what we are made of; he realizes we are made of clay. A person’s life is like grass. Like a flower in the field it flourishes, but when the hot wind blows by, it disappears, and one can no longer even spot the place where it once grew.

He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain, and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds. He makes the clouds his chariot, and travels along on the wings of the wind. He makes the winds his messengers, and the flaming fire his attendant. He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be upended. The watery deep covered it like a garment; the waters reached above the mountains. Your shout made the waters retreat; at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off – as the mountains rose up, and the valleys went down – to the place you appointed for them. You set up a boundary for them that they could not cross, so that they would not cover the earth again. He turns springs into streams; they flow between the mountains. They provide water for all the animals in the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. The birds of the sky live beside them; they chirp among the bushes. He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace; the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow. He provides grass for the cattle, and crops for people to cultivate, so they can produce food from the ground, as well as wine that makes people feel so good, and so they can have oil to make their faces shine, as well as food that sustains people’s lives. The trees of the Lord receive all the rain they need, the cedars of Lebanon which he planted, where the birds make nests, near the evergreens in which the herons live. The wild goats live in the high mountains; the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs. He made the moon to mark the months, and the sun sets according to a regular schedule. You make it dark and night comes, during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around. The lions roar for prey, seeking their food from God. When the sun rises, they withdraw and sleep in their dens. Men then go out to do their work, and labor away until evening. How many living things you have made, O Lord! You have exhibited great skill in making all of them; the earth is full of the living things you have made. Over here is the deep, wide sea, which teems with innumerable swimming creatures, living things both small and large. The ships travel there, and over here swims the whale you made to play in it. All of your creatures wait for you to provide them with food on a regular basis. You give food to them and they receive it; you open your hand and they are filled with food. When you ignore them, they panic. When you take away their life’s breath, they die and return to dust. When you send your life-giving breath, they are created, and you replenish the surface of the ground. May the splendor of the Lord endure! May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made! He looks down on the earth and it shakes; he touches the mountains and they start to smolder. I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist! May my thoughts be pleasing to him! I will rejoice in the Lord. May sinners disappear from the earth, and the wicked vanish! Praise the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!"

Boast about his holy name! Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice! Seek the Lord and the strength he gives! Seek his presence continually! Recall the miraculous deeds he performed, his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed, O children of Abraham, God’s servant, you descendants of Jacob, God’s chosen ones! He is the Lord our God; he carries out judgment throughout the earth. He always remembers his covenantal decree, the promise he made to a thousand generations – the promise he made to Abraham, the promise he made by oath to Isaac! He gave it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as a lasting promise, saying, ‘To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.’ When they were few in number, just a very few, and resident foreigners within it, they wandered from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another. He let no one oppress them; he disciplined kings for their sake, saying, ‘Don’t touch my chosen ones! Don’t harm my prophets!’ He called down a famine upon the earth; he cut off all the food supply. He sent a man ahead of them – Joseph was sold as a servant. The shackles hurt his feet; his neck was placed in an iron collar, until the time when his prediction came true. The Lord’s word proved him right. The king authorized his release; the ruler of nations set him free. He put him in charge of his palace, and made him manager of all his property, giving him authority to imprison his officials and to teach his advisers. Israel moved to Egypt; Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham. The Lord made his people very fruitful, and made them more numerous than their enemies. He caused them to hate his people, and to mistreat his servants. He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. They executed his miraculous signs among them, and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham. He made it dark; they did not disobey his orders. He turned their water into blood, and killed their fish. Their land was overrun by frogs, which even got into the rooms of their kings. He ordered flies to come; gnats invaded their whole territory. He sent hail along with the rain; there was lightning in their land. He destroyed their vines and fig trees, and broke the trees throughout their territory. He ordered locusts to come, innumerable grasshoppers. They ate all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the crops of their fields. He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of their reproductive power. He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold; none of his tribes stumbled. Egypt was happy when they left, for they were afraid of them. He spread out a cloud for a cover, and provided a fire to light up the night. They asked for food, and he sent quails; he satisfied them with food from the sky. He opened up a rock and water flowed out; a river ran through dry regions. Yes, he remembered the sacred promise he made to Abraham his servant. When he led his people out, they rejoiced; his chosen ones shouted with joy. He handed the territory of nations over to them, and they took possession of what other peoples had produced, so that they might keep his commands and obey his laws. Praise the Lord!"

How blessed are those who promote justice, and do what is right all the time! Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people! Pay attention to me, when you deliver, so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, rejoice along with your nation, and boast along with the people who belong to you. We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, we have done evil. Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds, they failed to remember your many acts of loyal love, and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea. Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation, that he might reveal his power. He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up; he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert. He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them, and rescued them from the power of the enemy. The water covered their enemies; not even one of them survived. They believed his promises; they sang praises to him. They quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions. In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; they challenged God in the desert. He granted their request, then struck them with a disease. In the camp they resented Moses, and Aaron, the Lord’s holy priest. The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it engulfed the group led by Abiram. Fire burned their group; the flames scorched the wicked. They made an image of a calf at Horeb, and worshiped a metal idol. They traded their majestic God for the image of an ox that eats grass. They rejected the God who delivered them, the one who performed great deeds in Egypt, amazing feats in the land of Ham, mighty acts by the Red Sea. He threatened to destroy them, but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him and turned back his destructive anger. They rejected the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise. They grumbled in their tents; they did not obey the Lord. So he made a solemn vow that he would make them die in the desert, make their descendants die among the nations, and scatter them among foreign lands. They worshiped Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead. They made the Lord angry by their actions, and a plague broke out among them. Phinehas took a stand and intervened, and the plague subsided. This brought him a reward, an eternal gift. They made him angry by the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them, for they aroused his temper, and he spoke rashly. They did not destroy the nations, as the Lord had commanded them to do. They mixed in with the nations and learned their ways. They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons. They shed innocent blood – the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted by bloodshed. They were defiled by their deeds, and unfaithful in their actions. So the Lord was angry with his people and despised the people who belong to him. He handed them over to the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them. Their enemies oppressed them; they were subject to their authority. Many times he delivered them, but they had a rebellious attitude, and degraded themselves by their sin. Yet he took notice of their distress, when he heard their cry for help. He remembered his covenant with them, and relented because of his great loyal love. He caused all their conquerors to have pity on them. Deliver us, O Lord, our God! Gather us from among the nations! Then we will give thanks to your holy name, and boast about your praiseworthy deeds. The Lord God of Israel deserves praise, in the future and forevermore. Let all the people say, ‘We agree!

Let those delivered by the Lord speak out, those whom he delivered from the power of the enemy, and gathered from foreign lands, from east and west, from north and south. They wandered through the wilderness on a desert road; they found no city in which to live. They were hungry and thirsty; they fainted from exhaustion. They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. He led them on a level road, that they might find a city in which to live. Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people! For he has satisfied those who thirst, and those who hunger he has filled with food. They sat in utter darkness, bound in painful iron chains, because they had rebelled against God’s commands, and rejected the instructions of the sovereign king. So he used suffering to humble them; they stumbled and no one helped them up. They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. He brought them out of the utter darkness, and tore off their shackles. Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people! For he shattered the bronze gates, and hacked through the iron bars. They acted like fools in their rebellious ways, and suffered because of their sins. They lost their appetite for all food, and they drew near the gates of death. They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. He sent them an assuring word and healed them; he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped. Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people! Let them present thank offerings, and loudly proclaim what he has done! Some traveled on the sea in ships, and carried cargo over the vast waters. They witnessed the acts of the Lord, his amazing feats on the deep water. He gave the order for a windstorm, and it stirred up the waves of the sea. They reached up to the sky, then dropped into the depths. The sailors’ strength left them because the danger was so great. They swayed and staggered like a drunk, and all their skill proved ineffective. They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. He calmed the storm, and the waves grew silent. The sailors rejoiced because the waves grew quiet, and he led them to the harbor they desired. Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people! Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people! Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside! He turned streams into a desert, springs of water into arid land, and a fruitful land into a barren place, because of the sin of its inhabitants. As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into springs of water. He allowed the hungry to settle there, and they established a city in which to live. They cultivated fields, and planted vineyards, which yielded a harvest of fruit. He blessed them so that they became very numerous. He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number. As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down, because of painful distress and suffering. He would pour contempt upon princes, and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road. Yet he protected the needy from oppression, and cared for his families like a flock of sheep. When the godly see this, they rejoice, and every sinner shuts his mouth. Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things! Let them consider the Lord’s acts of loyal love!"

May his children roam around begging, asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home! May the creditor seize all he owns! May strangers loot his property! May no one show him kindness! May no one have compassion on his fatherless children! May his descendants be cut off! May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives! May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the Lord! May his mother’s sin not be forgotten! May the Lord be constantly aware of them, and cut off the memory of his children from the earth! For he never bothered to show kindness; he harassed the oppressed and needy, and killed the disheartened. He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him. He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings. He made cursing a way of life, so curses poured into his stomach like water and seeped into his bones like oil. May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on, or a belt one wears continually! May the Lord repay my accusers in this way, those who say evil things about me! O sovereign Lord, intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation! Because your loyal love is good, deliver me! For I am oppressed and needy, and my heart beats violently within me. I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day; I am shaken off like a locust. I am so starved my knees shake; I have turned into skin and bones. I am disdained by them. When they see me, they shake their heads. Help me, O Lord my God! Because you are faithful to me, deliver me! Then they will realize this is your work, and that you, Lord, have accomplished it. They curse, but you will bless. When they attack, they will be humiliated, but your servant will rejoice. My accusers will be covered with shame, and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe. I will thank the Lord profusely, in the middle of a crowd I will praise him, because he stands at the right hand of the needy, to deliver him from those who threaten his life."

Tremble, O earth, before the Lord – before the God of Jacob, who turned a rock into a pool of water, a hard rock into springs of water! Not to us, O Lord, not to us! But to your name bring honor, for the sake of your loyal love and faithfulness. Why should the nations say, ‘Where is their God?’ Our God is in heaven! He does whatever he pleases! Their idols are made of silver and gold – they are man-made. They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see, ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell, hands, but cannot touch, feet, but cannot walk. They cannot even clear their throats. Those who make them will end up like them, as will everyone who trusts in them. O Israel, trust in the Lord! He is their deliverer and protector. O family of Aaron, trust in the Lord! He is their deliverer and protector. You loyal followers of the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is their deliverer and protector. The Lord takes notice of us, he will bless – he will bless the family of Israel, he will bless the family of Aaron. He will bless his loyal followers, both young and old. May he increase your numbers, yours and your children’s! May you be blessed by the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth! The heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth he has given to mankind. The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any of those who descend into the silence of death. But we will praise the Lord now and forevermore. Praise the Lord!"

If your sons keep my covenant and the rules I teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne forever.’ Certainly the Lord has chosen Zion; he decided to make it his home.

Where can I go to escape your spirit? Where can I flee to escape your presence? If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there. If I were to sprawl out in Sheol, there you would be. If I were to fly away on the wings of the dawn, and settle down on the other side of the sea, even there your hand would guide me, your right hand would grab hold of me. If I were to say, ‘Certainly the darkness will cover me, and the light will turn to night all around me,’ even the darkness is not too dark for you to see, and the night is as bright as day; darkness and light are the same to you. Certainly you made my mind and heart; you wove me together in my mother’s womb. I will give you thanks because your deeds are awesome and amazing. You knew me thoroughly; my bones were not hidden from you, when I was made in secret and sewed together in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw me when I was inside the womb. All the days ordained for me were recorded in your scroll before one of them came into existence. How difficult it is for me to fathom your thoughts about me, O God! How vast is their sum total! If I tried to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. Even if I finished counting them, I would still have to contend with you. If only you would kill the wicked, O God! Get away from me, you violent men! They rebel against you and act deceitfully; your enemies lie. O Lord, do I not hate those who hate you, and despise those who oppose you? I absolutely hate them, they have become my enemies! Examine me, and probe my thoughts! Test me, and know my concerns! See if there is any idolatrous tendency in me, and lead me in the reliable ancient path!"
