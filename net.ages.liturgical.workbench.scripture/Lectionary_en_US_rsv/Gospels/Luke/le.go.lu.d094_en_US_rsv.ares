But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, \"Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them."
