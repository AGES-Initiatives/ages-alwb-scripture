leprVE.reading.text = "The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, And no torture will ever touch them. In the eyes of the undiscerning they seemed to have died, And their departure was considered to be misfortune, And their passage from us to be their destruction; But they are at peace. For though in man's view they were punished, Their hope is full of immortality. Though chastened in a few things, Great kindness will be shown them, For God tested them and found them worthy of Himself. He tested them like gold in a furnace And accepted them as a whole burnt offering. In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, And they will run about like sparks through straw. They will judge nations and rule over peoples, And the Lord shall reign over them unto the ages. Those who trust in Him will understand truth, And the faithful shall continue with Him in love, Because grace and mercy are upon His elect."
