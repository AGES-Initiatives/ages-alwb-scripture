leprVE.reading.text = "The mouth of a righteous man distills wisdom, But the tongue of an unrighteous man utterly destroys. The lips of righteous men distill grace, But the mouth of the ungodly is perverse. Deceitful scales are an abomination before the Lord, But a righteous weight is acceptable to Him. Wherever arrogance enters, there also is dishonor, But the mouth of the humble meditates on wisdom. When a righteous man dies, he leaves regret, But the destruction of the ungodly is immediate and brings joy. Righteousness cuts straight and blameless paths, But ungodliness embraces wrongdoing. The righteousness of upright men delivers them, But lawless men are taken to their destruction. When a righteous man dies, his hope does not perish, But the boast of the ungodly perishes. A righteous man escapes from a snare, But the ungodly man is handed over in his place. There is a snare for citizens in the mouth of the ungodly, But the perception of the righteous is prosperous. A city stays upright in the good things of the righteous, But it is razed to the ground by the mouths of the ungodly. A man in need of discernment treats citizens with contempt, But a man of discernment keeps quiet."
