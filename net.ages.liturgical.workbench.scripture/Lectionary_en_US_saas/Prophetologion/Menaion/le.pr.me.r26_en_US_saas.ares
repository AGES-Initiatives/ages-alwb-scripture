leprVE.reading.text = "The righteous live forever, And their reward is with the Lord; And their care is by the Most High. Therefore they shall receive a kingly dwelling of dignity And a crown of beauty from the hand of the Lord, Because He will shelter them with His right hand And protect them with His arm. He will take His zeal as His full armor And will turn His creation into weapons against His enemies. He will wear righteousness as a breastplate And put on impartial judgment as a helmet. He will take holiness as an unconquerable shield And sharpen His relentless wrath for a sword; And creation will fight with Him against the senseless. Well-aimed flashes of lightning will strike And leap to their object as from a well-drawn bow of clouds; And hailstones full of anger will be hurled As from an engine of war. The water of the sea will be vexed with them, And the rivers will wash over them severely. A powerful wind will oppose them, And like a storm it will winnow them away. Lawlessness will lay waste all the earth, And wrongdoing will overturn the thrones of rulers. Listen therefore, O kings, and understand; Learn, O judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, you that rule over multitudes, And take pride in yourself over a multitude of nations. For power was given to you from the Lord, And your lordship from the Most High."
