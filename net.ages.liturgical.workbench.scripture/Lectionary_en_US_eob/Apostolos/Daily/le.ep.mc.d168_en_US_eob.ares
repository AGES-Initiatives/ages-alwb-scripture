Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. By the grace that was given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think [of yourselves] more highly than you should! Instead, think [of yourselves] reasonably, as God has apportioned to everyone a measure of faith."
