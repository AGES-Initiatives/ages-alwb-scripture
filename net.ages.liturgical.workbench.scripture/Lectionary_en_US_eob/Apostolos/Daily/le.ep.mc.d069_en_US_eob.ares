lemcVE.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I received from the Lord what also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.” Likewise, he also took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Therefore, whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let everyone do a self-examination, and then eat the bread and drink from the cup. For whoever eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgment to himself, if such a one does not discern the body of the Lord. For this reason, many among you are weak and sick, and many have fallen asleep. For if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged, but when we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, so that we may not be condemned with the world."

From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen."

Indeed, one will hardly die for someone righteous, but perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die. But God entrusts his own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Even more so then, since we are now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him! For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more shall we be saved by his life!"

In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise. Again: I will put my trust in him, and: Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me. Since the children have shared in [the same] flesh and blood, he likewise shared the same [human nature], so that through death he might bring to nothing the one who had the power of death – the devil – and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to life-long slavery. Certainly, Jesus did not take on the [nature of] angels, but [that of] Abraham’s seed. For this reason, he had to be made like his brethren in all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, {able} to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Moreover, since he himself suffered and was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."

lemcH9.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we have boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by the way which he opened for us (a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh). Yes, since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart full of faith. Since our hearts have been sprinkled from an evil conscience and our body washed with pure water, let us hang on to the confession of our hope without wavering because the one who made the promise is faithful. Let us consider one another, how we may stimulate love and good works. Let us not abandon our own gatherings, which is the habit of some. Instead, exhort one another, and even more as you see the Day approaching. But if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no more sacrifice for sins. All that remains is a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire which will devour the adversaries. One who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. How much worse a punishment, do you think, will one receive who has trampled the Son of God and profaned the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified, and offended the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” And also, “The Lord will judge his people.” It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!"
