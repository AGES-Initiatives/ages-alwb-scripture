He that dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them. Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his fury. But I have been made king by him on Zion his holy mountain, declaring the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to me: You are my Son, today have I begotten you. Ask of me and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession. You shall rule them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces as a potter’s vessel. Now, therefore understand, you kings: be instructed, all you that judge the earth.

I will be glad and exult in you: I will sing to your name, O you Most High. When my enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and perish at your presence. For you have maintained my cause and my right; you sat on the throne, that judge righteousness. You have rebuked the nations and the ungodly one has perished; you have blotted out their name for ever, even unto ages of ages. The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and you have destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise, but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment. He will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness. The Lord also has become a refuge for the poor, a timely help in affliction. Let those who know your name hope in you: for you, O Lord, have not failed those who diligently seek you. Sing praises to the Lord who dwells in Zion: declare his dealings among the nations. For he remembered them, in avenging for blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon the affliction I suffer of my enemies, you that lift me up from the gates of death: that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will exult in your salvation. The heathen are caught in the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot taken. The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. Let sinners be driven away into hades, even all the nations that forget God. For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before you. Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are mere humans. [Pause.] Why stand you afar off, O Lord? why do you overlook us in times of need, in affliction? While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is hotly pursued: the wicked are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine. Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself. The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his pride he will not seek after him: God is not before him. His ways are profane at all times; your judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies. For the sinner has said in his heart, “I shall not be moved from generation to generation without evil.” His mouth is full of cursing, bitterness and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain. He lies in wait with rich men in secret places, in order to kill the innocent: his eyes are set against the poor.

He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: God has turned away his face so as never to look. Arise, O Lord God; let your hand be lifted up: Do not forget the poor. Why then, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, God will not punish. You see it; for you do observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into your hands: the poor has been left to you; you were a helper to the orphan.

The Lord shall reign for ever, even unto ages of ages: you Gentiles shall perish out his land. The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: your ear has inclined to the state of their heart; to plead for the orphan and afflicted, so that one may ever boast upon the earth."

I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from my enemies. The pangs of death pressed on me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. The pangs of hades came around me: the snares of death encircled me. When I was afflicted I called upon the Lord and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple; my cry shall enter before him, even into his ears. Then the earth shook and quaked, the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, they were shaken, because God was angry with them. There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. He bowed the heaven and came down: thick darkness was under his feet. He mounted on cherubim and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. He made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, even dark water in the clouds of the air. At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. He sent forth his weapons and scattered them; he multiplied lightnings and they were confused. The springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of your wrath. He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters. He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from those who hate me; for they are stronger than I. They prevented me in the day of my affliction: but the Lord was my stay against them. He brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. The Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me. For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me. I shall be blameless with them, and shall keep myself from my iniquity. The Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes. With the holy you will be holy; and with the innocent you will be innocent. With the excellent man you will be excellent; and with the perverse you will show your strength. For you will save the lowly people, and will humble the eyes of the proud. For you, O Lord, will light my lamp: my God, you will lighten my darkness. For by you shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. As for my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all those who hope in him. For who is God but the Lord? And who is a god except our God? It is God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: who strengthens my feet as the feet of a deer, and sets me upon high places. He instructs my hands for war: and you have made my arms as a brazen bow. You have made me secure in my salvation: your right hand has helped me and your correction has upheld me to the end; yes, your correction itself shall instruct me. You have made room for my goings under me, and by footsteps did not fail. I will pursue my enemies and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed. I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet. For you have girded me with strength for war: you have beaten down under me all that rose up against me. you have also shown me the back of my enemies [as they fled]; and you have destroyed those who hated me. They cried, but there was no deliverer: even to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them. I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind. Deliver me from the opposition of the people: you shall make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me, at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: foreign children cringed before me. The foreign children became old, they became lame and fell away from their paths. The Lord lives; and blessed be my God; Let the God of my salvation be exalted. It is God that avenges me, he has subdued the nations under me! [You are] my deliverer from angry enemies: you shall set me on high above those who rise up against me: you shall deliver me from the unrighteous man. Therefore I will confess to you, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to your name. God magnifies the deliverances of his king; he deals mercifully with David his anointed, and with his descendants for ever."

O my God, I will cry to you by day, but you will not hear: and [when I will cry to you] by night, it shall not be considered as folly to me. But you, the praise of Israel, dwell in a sanctuary. Our fathers hoped in you; they hoped and you did deliver them. They cried to you and were saved: they hoped in you and were not ashamed. But I am a worm and not a man; a reproach of men and scorn of the people. All who saw me mocked me: they spoke with their lips, they shook the head, saying: He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him, let the Lord save him if he takes pleasure in this man. For you are the one that drew me out of the womb; my hope from my mother’s breasts. I have depended on you from the womb: you are my God from my mother’s womb. Do not stand far away from me; for affliction is near and there is no helper. Many bullocks have surrounded me: fat bulls have beset me all around. They have opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and roaring lion. I am poured out like water and all my bones are loosened: my heart has become like melting wax. My strength is dried up like an empty jar; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and you have brought me down to the dust of death. For many dogs have surrounded me: the assembly of the wicked doers has encircled me: they have pierced my hands and my feet. They counted all my bones; and they observed and gazed at me. They parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots for my clothing. But you, O Lord, do not be distant to help: be ready to come to my assistance. Deliver my soul from the sword; my uniquely loved from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion’s mouth; in my humiliation, [save me] from the one-horned beast. I will declare your name to my brothers: in the midst of the assembly will I sing praise to you. you that fear the Lord, praise him; all you descendants of Jacob, glorify him: let all the descendants of Israel fear him. For he has not despised nor been angry at the supplication of the poor; nor turned away his face from me; but when I cried to him, he heard me. I praise you in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before those who fear him. The poor shall eat and be satisfied; and those who seek him shall praise the Lord: their heart shall live for ever. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him. For the kingdom is the Lord’s; He is the governor of the nations. All the prosperous of the earth have eaten and worshiped: all that go down to the earth shall fall down before him: my soul also lives to him, and my descendants shall serve him: the generation that is coming shall be known to the Lord.

For you are my strength and my refuge; and you shall guide me for your name’s sake and maintain me. You shall bring me out of the snare which they have hidden for me; for you, O Lord, are my defender. Into your hands I will commit my spirit: you have redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. You have hated those who idly persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord. I will exult and be glad in your mercy: for you have looked upon my affliction; you have saved my soul from distresses. You have not shut me up into the hands of the enemy: you have set my feet in a wide place. Pity me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with indignation, my soul and my inner being. For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled. I became a reproach among all my enemies, but even more so to my neighbors and a fear to my acquaintance: those who saw me without fled from me. I have been forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I have become as a broken vessel. For I heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life.  But I hoped in you, O Lord: I said: You are my God. My lots are in your hands: deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me. Make your face to shine upon your servant: save me in your mercy. O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon you: let the ungodly be ashamed and brought down to hades. Let the deceitful lips become speechless, since they speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn. How abundant is the multitude of your goodness, O Lord, which you have laid up for those who fear you! You have accomplished it out for those who hope on you, in the presence of the sons of men. You will hide them in the secret of your presence from the scrutiny of man: you will screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of [slandering] tongues. Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city. But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of your eyes: therefore you did hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to you.
