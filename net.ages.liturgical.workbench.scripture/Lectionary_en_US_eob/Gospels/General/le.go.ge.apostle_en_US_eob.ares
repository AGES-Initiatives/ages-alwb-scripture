Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I confess you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for doing so was well-pleasing in your sight.”"
